# Minimalistic D&D Beyond
Using the instructions, you can have a minimalistic experience of the D&amp;D Beyond website and the digital 5e compendiums.

There's also instructions for getting a minimalistic experience using your current Chrome browser (either on PC/Mac or Chrome OS).

This repository keeps track of the CSS, JS and icon files used in the project. [Check out the forum post on DDB for more information on how to build your own, and customize](https://www.dndbeyond.com/forums/d-d-beyond-general/general-discussion/33813-taking-advantage-of-chrome-for-ddb-alternate-title).

I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH CURSE OR D&amp;D BEYOND PRODUCT, THIS IS A PERSONAL PROJECT BUILT ON FREE SOFTWARE.

## Bitrot...? (2021-02-18)
As you might have guessed, this project is suffering from bitrot. While the actual code here might still work, i wouldn't recommend using the code that is meant to change the DDB website.

The page reference work should still work fine, though. And it seems another project is picking up the data and doing a Chrome extension!
I have some hopes of doing another project related to the page references, but life has so far have other plans for me :-)
