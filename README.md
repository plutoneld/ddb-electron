Using the instructions, you can build a wrapper for the D&amp;D Beyond website. The wrapper was built with Nativefier, and this repository is used for keeping track of the CSS, JS and icon files used for this.[Check out the Wiki for more information on how to build your own, and customize](https://github.com/plutoneld/ddb-electron/wiki).

I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH CURSE OR D&amp;D BEYOND PRODUCT, THIS IS A PERSONAL PROJECT BUILT ON OPEN SOFTWARE.
