# Minimalistic D&D Beyond
Using the instructions, you can have a minimalistic experience of the D&amp;D Beyond website and the digital 5e compendiums.

There's also instructions for getting a minimalistic experience using your current Chrome browser (either on PC/Mac or Chrome OS).

This repository keeps track of the CSS, JS and icon files used in the project. [Check out the forum post on DDB for more information on how to build your own, and customize](https://www.dndbeyond.com/forums/d-d-beyond-general/general-discussion/33813-taking-advantage-of-chrome-for-ddb-alternate-title).

I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH CURSE OR D&amp;D BEYOND PRODUCT, THIS IS A PERSONAL PROJECT BUILT ON FREE SOFTWARE.
