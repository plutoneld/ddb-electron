# Minimalistic D&D Beyond
Using the instructions, you can have a minimalistic experience of the D&amp;D Beyond website and the digital 5e compendiums. If you want a desktop app for your PC/Mac, you can use the instructions for building a native app with Nativefier.

There's also instructions for getting a minimalistic experience using your current Chrome browser (either on PC/Mac or Chrome OS).

This repository keeps track of the CSS, JS and icon files used in the project. [Check out the Wiki for more information on how to build your own, and customize](https://github.com/plutoneld/minimalist-ddb/wiki).

I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH CURSE OR D&amp;D BEYOND PRODUCT, THIS IS A PERSONAL PROJECT BUILT ON FREE SOFTWARE.
